@book{Kreck.2010,
 abstract = {{\dq}This book presents a geometric introduction to the homology of topological spaces and the cohomology of smooth manifolds. The author introduces a new class of stratified spaces, so-called stratifolds. He derives basic concepts from differential topology such as Sard's theorem, partitions of unity and transversality. Based on this, homology groups are constructed in the framework of stratifolds and the homology axioms are proved. This implies that for nice spaces these homology groups agree with ordinary singular homology. Besides the standard computations of homology groups using the axioms, straightforward constructions of important homology classes are given. The author also defines stratifold cohomology groups following an idea of Quillen. Again, certain important cohomology classes occur very naturally in this description, for example, the characteristic classes which are constructed in the book and applied later on. One of the most fundamental results, Poincar{\'e} duality, is almost a triviality in this approach. Some fundamental invariants, such as the Euler characteristic and the signature, are derived from (co)homology groups. These invariants play a significant role in some of the most spectacular results in differential topology. In particular, the author proves a special case of Hirzebruch's signature theorem and presents as a highlight Milnor's exotic 7-spheres.{\dq}--Publisher's description.},

@book{Hatcher.2002,
 abstract = {'In most mathematics departments at major universities one of the three or four basic first-year graduate courses is in the subject of algebraic topology. This introductory textbook in algebraic topology is suitable for use in a course or for self-study, featuring broad coverage of the subject and a readable exposition, with many examples and exercises. The four main chapters present the basic material of the subject: fundamental group and covering spaces, homology and cohomology, higher homotopy groups, and homotopy theory generally. The author emphasizes the geometric aspects of the subject, which helps students gain intuition. A unique feature of the book is the inclusion of many optional topics which are not usually part of a first course due to time constraints, and for which elementary expositions are sometimes hard to find. Among these are: Bockstein and transfer homomorphisms, direct and inverse limits, H-spaces and Hopf algebras, the Brown representability theorem, the James reduced product, the Dold-Thom theorem, and a full exposition of Steenrod squares and powers. Researchers will also welcome this aspect of the book. ' from publisher's description.},

@book{Rotman.2010,
 abstract = {\{\dq}This book is designed as a text for the first year of graduate algebra, but it can also serve as a reference since it contains more advanced topics as well. This second edition has a different organization than the first. It begins with a discussion of the cubic and quartic equations, which leads into permutations, group theory, and Galois theory (for finite extensions; infinite Galois theory is discussed later in the book). The study of groups continues with finite abelian groups (finitely generated groups are discussed later, in the context of module theory), Sylow theorems, simplicity of projective unimodular groups, free groups and presentations, and the Nielsen-Schreier theorem (subgroups of free groups are free). The study of commutative rings continues with prime and maximal ideals, unique factorization, noetherian rings, Zorn's lemma and applications, varieties, and Gr{\"o}bner bases. Next, noncommutative rings and modules are discussed, treating tensor product, projective, injective, and flat modules, categories, functors, and natural transformations, categorical constructions (including direct and inverse limits), and adjoint functors. Then follow group representations: Wedderburn-Artin theorems, character theory, theorems of Burnside and Frobenius, division rings, Brauer groups, and abelian categories. Advanced linear algebra treats canonical forms for matrices and the structure of modules over PIDs, followed by multilinear algebra. Homology is introduced, first for simplicial complexes, then as derived functors, with applications to Ext, Tor, and cohomology of groups, crossed products, and an introduction to algebraic K-theory. Finally, the author treats localization, Dedekind rings and algebraic number theory, and homological dimensions. The book ends with the proof that regular local rings have unique factorization.\{\dq}--Publisher's description.},

@article{Friedl.2008b,
 abstract = {Let N be a closed, oriented 3-manifold. A folklore conjecture states that S$^1$ $\times$ N admits a symplectic structure only if N admits a fibration over the circle. The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence to this conjecture studying suitable twisted Alexander polynomials of N, and showing that their behavior is the same as of those of fibered 3-manifolds. In particular, we will obtain new obstructions to the existence of symplectic structures and to the existence of symplectic forms representing certain cohomology classes of S$^1$ $\times$ N. As an application of these results we will show that S$^1$ $\times$ N(P) does not admit a symplectic structure, where N(P) is the 0-surgery along the pretzel knot P = (5,-3,5), answering a question of Peter Kronheimer.},

@article{Dunfield.2010,
 abstract = {We exhibit a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold which satisfies a very strong form of Thurston's Virtual Fibration Conjecture. In particular, this manifold has finite covers which fiber over the circle in arbitrarily many ways. More precisely, it has a tower of finite covers where the number of fibered faces of the Thurston norm ball goes to infinity, in fact faster than any power of the logarithm of the degree of the cover, and we give a more precise quantitative lower bound. The example manifold M is arithmetic, and the proof uses detailed number-theoretic information, at the level of the Hecke eigenvalues, to drive a geometric argument based on Fried's dynamical characterization of the fibered faces. The origin of the basic fibration M $\rightarrow$ S$^1$ is the modular elliptic curve E = X$_0$(49), which admits multiplication by the ring of integers of {\$}{\Bbb Q}[$\backslash$sqrt {\{} - 7} ].{\$} . We first base change the holomorphic differential on E to a cusp form on GL(2) over {\$}k = [$\backslash$sqrt {\{} - 3} ],{\$} and then transfer over to a quaternion algebra D/K ramified only at the primes above 7; the fundamental group of M is a quotient of the principal congruence subgroup of {\$}O{\_}D^* {\$} of level 7. To analyze the topological properties of M, we use a new practical method for computing the Thurston norm, which is of independent interest. We also give a noncompact finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with the same properties by using a direct topological argument.},

@book{LickorishW.B.Raymond.1997,
 abstract = {This volume is an introduction to mathematical knot theory - the theory of knots and links of simple closed curves in three-dimensional space. It consists of a selection of topics that graduate students have found to be a successful introduction to the field. Three distinct techniques are employed: geometric topology manoeuvres; combinatorics; and algebraic topology. Each topic is developed until significant results are achieved, and chapters end with exercises and brief accounts of state-of-the-art research. What may reasonably be referred to as knot theory has expanded enormously over the last decade, and while the author describes important discoveries from throughout the twentieth century, the latest discoveries such as quantum invariants of 3-manifolds - as well as generalisations and applications of the Jones polynomial - are also included, presented in an easily understandable style. Thus, this constitutes a comprehensive introduction to the field, presenting modern developments in the context of classical material. Readers are assumed to have knowledge of the basic ideas of the fundamental group and simple homology theory, although explanations throughout the text are plentiful and well done. Written by an internationally known expert in the field, this volume will appeal to graduate students, mathematicians, and physicists with a mathematical background who wish to gain new insights in this area.},
